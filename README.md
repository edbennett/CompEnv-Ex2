# Computational Environment Example 3

## Orienting you to the GitHub repository

*There are lots of links here, they're here to help understand the different branches in GitHub.*

*If you already know this, then feel free to [jump to the instructions](#instructions) below.*

There are three branches in this repository.

* `master` : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/tree/master
* `branch-a` : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/tree/branch-1 
* `branch-b` : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/tree/branch-b

There's an **identical** jupyter notebook in all three branches.

* `chap03.ipynb` in `master` : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/blob/master/demo.ipynb
* `chap03.ipynb` in `branch-a` : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/blob/branch-a/demo.ipynb
* `chap03.ipynb` in `branch-b` : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/blob/branch-b/demo.ipynb

Two of the branches have environment files:

* `master` does not have an environment file.
* `branch-a` has an environment file : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/blob/branch-a/environment.yml
* `branch-b` has an environment file : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/blob/branch-b/environment.yml

## Instructions

1. Click the links below to open the Binders for `branch-a` and `branch-b`.
  These will take you directly to the jupyter notebook.
  We recommend you right click and select "Open Link in a New Tab" in order to keep these instructions visible.
 
* :point_right: Binder for `branch-a`: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/branch-a?filepath=demo.ipynb 
* :point_right: Binder for `branch-b`: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2/branch-b?filepath=demo.ipynb 

2. Run the code!

## Questions

* What's different between these two branches?
* What is the difference in the analysis?
* How do these differences arise?
